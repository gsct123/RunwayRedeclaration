# Runway Redecalaration Project

This project is designed to calculate the new runway parameters based on the user input for runway redeclaration. For the first increment, we have developed a working prototype that have predefined airport, runways and obstacles for users to perform calculation. The priority in this increment is to ensure the accuracy of calculation and the result of calculation is being displayed in textual form. 

## Dependencies

This project requires JavaFX to run. Please ensure that JavaFX is installed on your computer before running the application.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and type `java -version` to check if Java is installed on your computer. If Java is not installed, please install it before proceeding.

2. Navigate to the folder containing the `RunwayRedeclaration.jar` file.

3. Type the following command to run the application:

   `java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics -jar RunwayRedeclaration.jar`

   Replace `/path/to/javafx/lib` with the path to the directory containing the JavaFX runtime components on your system. This path will depend on the location where you installed JavaFX on your computer.

4. Press Enter to run the command. The application should launch and you can now input the required data for runway redeclaration.

## How to Use

Once the application is launched, you will see a form on the left hand side that you need to fill out either by selecting options or typing in values. Some menus have been disabled to ensure that the required information is selected before proceeding. Once all fields are completed, click on the "Perform Calculation" button to calculate the new runway parameters.

The calculated results will be displayed in the middle and right section of the applicatiob in the form of breakdown and comparison of new and original runway parameters
